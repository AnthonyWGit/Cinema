UPDATE 24/05/2023 : 
From this date on the project will be fully upgraded to a more OOP aproach. Be prepared to see some incoherent stuff while i fully revisit the code. 
For comparaison and curiosity i'll be uploading another repo wich will be the same as this one but it will show the state of it before beeing revisited into OOP.

All comments are welcome ! 

UPDATE 31/05/2023:
Started this project without using bootstrap, do't want to migrate to full BS (aka CDN). Installed node.js on my machine and tried to generate a css file with only modal related stuff because they are effectives and i want to use them for my register and login form.
